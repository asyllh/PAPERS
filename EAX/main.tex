\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Define CSP, single strip problem and multi-strip problem (SCSPP)
	\item Cite previous Heuristics paper, follow on
	\item Lit review
	\item Describe rest of paper, AHC single strip for CSP, Evolutionary Algorithm and Postopt
	\item Two phase approach, cite vertex colouring paper
\end{itemize}

\section{AHC}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Condensed version of algorithm from previous paper
	\item Set notation and terms to be used throughout paper
\end{itemize}

\section{Evolutionary Algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Create initial population, one solution using MFFD$^+$, the rest using MFFR$^+$
	\item Each solution in population is also mutated and local search is applied
	\item Choose two parent solutions from population
	\item Apply one of two recombination operators
	\item Paragraph for each operator, GGA and GPX'
	\item Explain why GPX cannot be used, cite Lewis paper
	\item Describe repair procedure using MFFD$^+$
	\item Section explaining Local Search, PairPair, PairSin, SinSin, MoveSin
	\item Note the use of feasPacking/infeasPacking sets to aid the search
	\item Reduces the number of times AHC needs to be called, for each group of items AHC should only be called once
	\item Preliminary check before calling AHC
	\item Once offspring is produced, calculate fitness of parents and offspring, replace worst parent with offspring in population
	\item Keep track of best fitness/best solution/time at each iteration, if better solution found then write to file, produce graph
	\item At the end of each EA iteration, add all strips from offspring to feasPacking set to use in post optimisation phase
	\item Number of items - 100, 500
	\item Time limit for EA - 10 minutes
	\item Width of strips - 2500, 5000
	\item Recombination operators - GGA, GPX', GPN
	\item GGA $1 < i < j < |\mathcal{S}_2|$ unlike in Rhyd paper to ensure that offspring has strips from both parents
	\item Types of instances - artificial, real
	
	\item Problem instance generator will produce 1000 instances for four different sets, number of items = 100 and 500 and artificial and real instances, 4000 problem instances in total
	\item Each of these sets will then be run 4 times using different arguments - strip width = 2500 and 5000, and either GGA or GPX'
	\item Overall there will be 16 types of outputs from EA
	
	\item In EA output file to compare:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Proportion of times feasPacking/infeasPacking sets used instead of AHC
		\item Number of strips in best solution found
		\item Number of iterations of EA within the given time limit
		\item Fitness value of the best solution found
		\item If best solution found is equivalent to the lowerbound
	\end{itemize}	
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Post-optimization}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Exact cover formulation, NP-hard, state the IP, describe DLX
	\item Use strips in feasPacking for post opt
	\item Compare with EA output - is a better solution found, or a solution with the same number of strips but a better fitness value?
	\item Is the post opt phase able to find a solution equal to the lowerbound?
	\item Post opt will only ever find a solution equal to or better than the solution found in EA, never worse
	\item Execution time
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Results}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Proportion of instances where best solution EA == lowerbound
	\item Proportion of instance where best solution post opt better than EA, and/or == lowerbound
	\item Comparison between GGA and GPX', artificial and real instance types, different strip widths and number of items
	\item check timestamps from EA output file - which type is able to reach a better solution at a faster rate?
	\item Differences in number of strips in best solution found in EA using different arguments
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Could use selected packings rather than all packings
\end{itemize}
